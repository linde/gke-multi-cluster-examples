The following directories highlight terraform examples mapped to some user journeys.

First, the [Platform Admin Provisioning](./platform-admin-provisioning/) jouryeys:

 * [project-level-setup](./platform-admin-provisioning/project-level-setup/)
 * [team-level-setup](./platform-admin-provisioning/team-level-setup/)
 * [team-resources](./platform-admin-provisioning/team-resources/)

In the above journeys, the Platform Admin provisions clusters and namespaces for the teams.

Going forward we will also add user journeys where Platform Admin/SRE self services.
